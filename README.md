**Image Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
Project Overview
This project is designed to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It classifies images into categories like "Car" vs. "Non-Car". The model is trained using a set of images and can predict whether a given image contains a car or not.

Features
Image Classification: The model uses CNNs to classify images based on whether they contain a car or not.
Real-Time Training: The model is trained using a large dataset, allowing it to classify images accurately.
Data Augmentation: The training data is augmented using techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping to increase the robustness of the model.
Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-detection.git

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the Dataset
To train the model, you need to have the image dataset organized in folders:

train_data: Contains images of cars and non-cars for training.
validation_data: Contains images of cars and non-cars for validation during training.
test_data: Contains unseen images used for testing the trained model.
The dataset should be placed in these directories as:

train_data/car
train_data/non_car
validation_data/car
validation_data/non_car
test_data/car
test_data/non_car
4. Train the Model
Once the dataset is ready, you can start training the model. Run the following command:

python train_model.py

The model will start training and output the accuracy and loss for each epoch. You can monitor the training progress and view the training history at the end.

5. Test the Model
After training, you can evaluate the performance of your model on the test dataset:

python test_model.py

This will output the accuracy of the model on unseen test data, showing how well it can generalize to new images.

6. View Results
After training, the model will display a graph showing the accuracy and loss curves during training and validation. This helps you track the model’s performance and ensure it's learning effectively.

Conclusion
This project uses CNNs for image classification. By training on a large dataset, the model can learn to classify images with high accuracy, even when faced with variations like rotation or zoom. It’s a powerful tool for real-time image recognition tasks.
